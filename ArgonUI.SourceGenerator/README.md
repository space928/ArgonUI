# ArgonUI.SourceGenerator

This package provides support for the automatic source generation used by ArgonUI.

## Debugging
Make sure to install the Roslyn SDK component in Visual Studio.

Please also note that Visual Studio likes to aggressivly cache things, so if the source generator
is behaving weirdly, restarting Visual Studio often helps.
